There are an [accompanying set of blog posts](https://epi052.gitlab.io/notes-to-self/blog/2019-09-01-how-to-build-an-automated-recon-pipeline-with-python-and-luigi/) detailing the development process and underpinnings of the pipeline.  Feel free to check them out if you're so inclined, but they're in no way required reading to use the tool.

Check out [recon-pipeline's readthedocs entry](https://recon-pipeline.readthedocs.io/) for some more in depth information than what this README provides.

## Installation

> Automatic installation tested on kali 2019.4 and Ubuntu 18.04

There are two primary phases for installation:

1. prior to [cmd2](https://github.com/python-cmd2/cmd2) being installed
2. everything else

First, the manual steps to get cmd2 installed in a virtual environment are as follows (and shown below), starting with [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv)

### Kali
```bash
apt install pipenv
```

### Ubuntu 18.04
```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip
pip install --user pipenv
echo "PATH=${PATH}:~/.local/bin" >> ~/.bashrc
bash
```

### Both OSs after pipenv install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/epi052/recon-pipeline.git
cd recon-pipeline
pipenv install
```

Once manual installation of [cmd2](https://github.com/python-cmd2/cmd2) is complete, the `recon-pipeline` shell provides its own `install` command (seen below).  A simple `install all` will handle all installation steps.

> Ubuntu-18.04 Note:  You may consider running `sudo -v` prior to running `./recon-pipeline.py`.  `sudo -v` will refresh your creds, and the underlying subprocess calls during installation won't prompt you for your password.  It'll work either way though.

## Command Execution

Command execution is handled through the `recon-pipeline` shell (seen below).

### Target File and Exempt List File (defining scope)

The pipeline expects a file that describes the target's scope to be provided as an argument to the `--target-file` option.  The target file can consist of domains, ip addresses, and ip ranges, one per line.

```text
tesla.com
tesla.cn
teslamotors.com
...
```

Some bug bounty scopes have expressly verboten subdomains and/or top-level domains, for that there is the `--exempt-list` option.  The exempt list follows the same rules as the target file.

```text
shop.eu.teslamotors.com
energysupport.tesla.com
feedback.tesla.com
...
```

### Using a Scheduler

The backbone of this pipeline is spotify's [luigi](https://github.com/spotify/luigi) batch process management framework.  Luigi uses the concept of a scheduler in order to manage task execution.  Two types of scheduler are available, a local scheduler and a central scheduler.  The local scheduler is useful for development and debugging while the central scheduler provides the following two benefits:

- Make sure two instances of the same task are not running simultaneously
- Provide visualization of everything thatâ€™s going on

While in the `recon-pipeline` shell, running `install luigi-service` will copy the `luigid.service` file provided in the
repo to its appropriate systemd location and start/enable the service.  The result is that the central scheduler is up
and running easily.

The other option is to add `--local-scheduler` to your `scan` command from within the `recon-pipeline` shell.
